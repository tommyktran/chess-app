# Chess App

This simple console application allows you to access the Lichess API to view the statistics for different chess opening moves.

Packages needed: json, requests, tabulate (version 0.8.9)

To run the program, use "py main.py" from the command line.

The program takes chess moves in UCI notation as input. If you are not familiar with this form of chess notation, you may enter a space to use a default value, "e2e4 e7e5." Or, you may use some of these:

- d2d4 d7d5
- e2e4 e7e6 d2d4 d7d5
- c2c4 e7e5
